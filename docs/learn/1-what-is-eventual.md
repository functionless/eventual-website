# What is Eventual?

Eventual is a code-first service and software development kit (SDK) that helps developers build serverless micro-services in AWS with Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

## Service

The top-level Concept of Eventual is a Service. Eventual provides you abstractions for defining your Service's Interface with `APIs` and `Events`, and then performing Event-Driven Orchestration & Choreography with `Workflows`, `Activities` and `Subscriptions`.

![Service Contract](../reference/service-contract.png)

### `Service` Construct

It's a totally encapsulated micro-service deployable with a simple Construct that can be instantiated in an AWS CDK or Pulumi application.

For example, you can use the [`Service`](../reference/service.md) Construct to deploy a fully functional service to AWS using the AWS CDK.

```ts
new Service(this, "invoice-service", {
  entry: require.resolve("@my-company/invoice-service"),
});
```

This includes an API Gateway, Event Bus and Workflow engine, all running within your own account.

### Composing and Evolving Services

Services are designed to be composable and evolvable.

For example, you can route events between services, making it easy to separate concerns and add new Services over time.

```ts
import { orderEvent } from "@my-company/order-service";

invoiceService.subscribe({
  service: orderService,
  events: [orderEvent],
});
```

## Building Blocks

The business logic of a Service is built with plug-and-play primitives that are coordinated by a powerful workflow engine.

### Command

For example, you can register a Command on your Service's API with the [`command`](../reference/api/command.md) primitive:

```ts
export const sendInvoice = command("sendInvoice", async (invoice: Invoice) => {
  await invoiceDB.putItem(item);
});
```

:::info How it works
Eventual analyzes your code to detect this route and automatically attach it to the API Gateway. Eventual does similar work for all primitives.
:::

### Event (Pub/Sub)

With pub/sub messaging, messages sent by the publisher are processed by different subscribers. Each consumer receives its own copy of the message for processing.

Events are records of something that has occurred (for example a change in the state of data within a Service) that other components and services listen to.

![](/img/pub-sub.svg)

They can be easily created with the [`event`](../reference/messaging/event.md) primitive:

```ts
const orderEvent = event("Order");
```

... and then subscribed to:

```ts
orderEvent.onEvent((event) => {
  // process order
});
```

... published to:

```ts
await orderEvent.publishEvents({
  orderId,
  orderTime,
});
```

... and routed between Services:

```ts
invoiceService.subscribe({
  service: orderService,
  events: ["OrderEvent"],
});
```

:::info
You can publish an event from APIs, Event Handlers, Workflows, Activities or even from outside Eventual.
:::

:::tip Designed for end-to-end type safety

The schema for an Event can be defined in code to catch errors at compile time, improve IDE auto-completion and generate documentation.

```ts
interface OrderEvent {
  orderId: string;
  orderTime: string;
}

const orderEvent = event<OrderEvent>("Order");

orderEvent.onEvent((event) => {
  event.id; // Error!!! property 'id' does not exist on type OrderEvent
});
```

:::

### Workflows

Workflows are the powerhouse of Eventual. With them, you can build long-running, fault tolerant processes with the expressivity and flexibility of ordinary imperative code.

```ts
const processOrderWorkflow = workflow("order", async (order: Order) => {
  const charge = await chargeCreditCard(order.source, order.amount);

  try {
    await dispatchOrder(order);
  } catch {
    await chargeBack(charge.chargeId);
  }
});
```

:::caution More than meets the eye
This may look like a typical function but it's actually a workflow that can span days, months or even years without failure.
:::

:::tip
Workflows provide runtime guarantees that can't be ordinarily achieved within APIs, Event Handlers or Activities. They are the glue that coordinates time, connects services and makes them reliable.
:::

### Activity

An [Activity](../reference/orchestration/activity.md) is a logical unit of work that can be called from a workflow. Workflows do the orchestration while Activities perform the actual work.

For example, a function to integrate with Stripe to charge Credit Cards:

```ts
const chargeCreditCard = activity(
  "chargeCC",
  async (source: string, amount: number) => {
    await stripe.charges.create({
      amount,
      source,
      currency: "usd",
    });
  }
);
```

### Signal

Services live in the real world where information is constantly flowing and changing. You can use Signals to send information into a running workflow and change its course, for example to cancel an order that is inflight.

```ts
const cancelSignal = signal("cancel");

const processOrder = workflow("processOrder", async (order: Order) => {
  cancelSignal.onSignal(async () => {
    await cancelOrder(order);
  });
});
```

:::info

Signals can be sent from anywhere within an Eventual application, for example an API:

```ts
api.post("/order/:orderId/cancel", async (request) => {
  await cancelSignal.sendSignal({
    executionId: request.params.orderId,
  });
});
```

:::

### Integrations

Services don't operate within a vacuum. Eventual's powerful orchestration capabilities are designed to integrate with any Cloud Resource or SaaS product.

For example, Eventual has no opinion on your choice of database - so you can use DynamoDB to store and retrieve data:

```ts
api.post("/user", async (request) => {
  await dynamoClient.putItem({
    TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
    Item: await request.json(),
  });
});
```

:::info
Integrations go far beyond just AWS Resources - for example, perhaps you want to register a webhook in Slack:

```ts
const slack = new Slack("my-slack-connection", { credentials });

slack.command("/hello", (request) => {
  request.ack("hello world");
});
```

:::

## Local Simulation and Testing

Eventual's [Unit Testing](../reference/unit-testing.md) library enables you to iterate on your application locally without wasting cycles waiting for deployments.

```ts
// advance the simulation's time
await env.tick();

// check the status of a running workflow has changed to SUCCESS
expect(await execution.getStatus()).toMatchObject({
  status: ExecutionStatus.SUCCESS,
});
```

:::info
The `env` variable points to a [`TestEnvironment`](../reference/unit-testing.md#testenvironment) which supports mocking components of a service such as Activities and Events, as well as controlling how time progresses.
:::

## Time Machine Debugging

Debugging distributed systems in the cloud is a near impossible task. Eventual's Time Machine Debugging feature allows you to replay a workflow execution that has already run (or is still running) locally within your IDE and debugger.
