# Getting Started

Eventual is a set of NPM packages and a CDK Construct that helps you build microservices and provision corresponding AWS resources.

## 0. Pre-requisites

Before getting started with Eventual, you'll need:

- [Node JS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- NPM 7+ or Yarn 1+ or PNPM
- An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## 1. Create a new project

To create a new Eventual project, run:

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 2. Choose your preferred IaC platform

Eventual currently supports two IaC platforms: AWS CDK and AWS SST. You'll be prompted to choose between them when you create a new project. Select [`aws-cdk`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) or [`aws-sst`](https://docs.sst.dev) as appropriate.

<Tabs groupId="platform">
  <TabItem value="aws-cdk" label="aws-cdk" default>
    <CodeBlock>
      {`? target: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ aws-cdk
  aws-sst
`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sst" label="sst">
    <CodeBlock>
      {`? target: (Use arrow keys)
  aws-cdk
‚ùØ aws-sst`}
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 3. Deploy the application

Use the `deploy` script to deploy your application to AWS.

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. List services in your AWS account

After deploying, let's now list the Eventual services we just deployed to our AWS account:

```ts
> npx eventual list services
my-service
```

As you can see, we have a single service, `my-service` that was just deployed.

## 5. List workflows

To list the workflows available in our new service, use the `eventual list workflows` command. For example:

```ts
> npx eventual list workflows
myWorkflow
```

## 6. List the endpoints

To view the API Gateway URL and Event Bus ARN for a service, use the `eventual get service` command:

```ts
> npx eventual get service
API Gateway: 	  https://<uuid>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Event Bus ARN:  arn:aws:events:us-west-2:<account-id>:event-bus/my-service
```

## 7. Make an API HTTP request

Use a tool like `curl` to make an HTTP request to the API Gateway endpoint for the `/work` API. This will trigger a workflow execution:

```
> curl -X POST https://<uuid>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/work\
  -d '["item1", "item2"]'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will return a JSON object containing the execution ID for the triggered workflow execution.

```json
{ "executionId": "<execution-id>" }
```

## 8. Get the logs for the execution

To view the logs for the workflow execution we just started, use the `eventual get logs` command followed by the `--execution` flag and the execution ID:

```
> npx eventual get logs --execution <execution-id>
```
