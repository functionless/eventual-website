# Quick Start

Eventual is a set of NPM packages and a CDK Construct that helps you build microservices and provision corresponding AWS resources.

## Install Node and set up AWS

Before getting started with Eventual, you'll need:

- [Node JS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- NPM 7+ or Yarn 1+ or PNPM
- An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Create a new project

To create a new Eventual project, run:

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Choose the name for your Project

```
> project name: my-service
```

## Review the created project structure

The project template generates the following project structure containing 3 NPM packages:

```bash
my-service
â”œâ”€â”€README.md # a README cont
â”œâ”€â”€infra # an AWS CDK application that deploys the repo's infrastructure
â”œâ”€â”€apps
    â”œâ”€â”€my-service # the NPM package containing the my-service business logic
â”œâ”€â”€packages
    â”œâ”€â”€events # a shared NPM package containing event definitions
```

## View the `README.md` for helpful information

The generated `README.md` file in the root of your project contains useful information such as project overview, noteworthy Lambda Functions and CloudWatch Log Groups, and helpful scripts to use as a part of your developer workflow.

## Deploy the application

Use the `deploy` script to deploy your application to AWS.

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## List services in your AWS account

After deploying, let's now list the Eventual services we just deployed to our AWS account:

```ts
npx eventual list services
```

## Get the Service's endpoints

To view the API Gateway URL and Event Bus ARN for a service, use the `eventual show service` command:

```ts
npx eventual show service
```

## Make an API HTTP request

Use a tool like `curl` to make an HTTP request to the API Gateway endpoint for the `/work` API. This will trigger a workflow execution:

```
curl -X POST <api-endpoint>/rpc/hello -d '"sam"'
```

This will return a JSON object containing the execution ID for the triggered workflow execution.

```json
{ "executionId": "<execution-id>" }
```

## Get the status of the Workflow execution

You can get the status and result of a workflow execution using the `eventual get execution` command:

```
npx eventual get execution <execution-id>
```

## View the logs for the execution

To view the logs for the workflow execution we just started, use the `eventual get logs` command followed by the `--execution` flag and the execution ID:

```
npx eventual get logs --execution <execution-id>
```
