# Quick Start

Eventual is a set of NPM packages and a CDK Construct that helps you build microservices and provision corresponding AWS resources.

## Install Node and set up AWS

Before getting started with Eventual, you'll need:

- [Node JS 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- NPM 7+ or Yarn 1+ or PNPM
- An [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Create a new project

To create a new Eventual project, run:

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Choose a name for your Project

You will be prompted for name of your project, e.g. `my-project`.

```
project name: my-project
```

:::tip
Choose a name that represents an organization, team or product - Eventual is mono-repo based and can contain multiple services all deployed together.

For example, you may want to choose the name of your GitHub repository name: `my-awesome-product`.
:::

## Choose the name of your _first_ Service

You will then be prompted for the name of your first service, e.g. `my-service`.

```
service name: my-service
```

:::info
The service name determines the name of your first service which is a NPM package in the `apps/` folder, e.g. `apps/my-service`. You can create more services within the same repository later!
:::

## Deploy the application

Use the `deploy` script to deploy your application to AWS.

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm run deploy</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## List services in your AWS account

After deploying, let's now list the Eventual services we just deployed to our AWS account:

```ts
> npx eventual list services
my-service
```

As you can see, we have a single service, `my-service` that was just deployed.

## List workflows

To list the workflows available in our new service, use the `eventual list workflows` command. For example:

```ts
> npx eventual list workflows
myWorkflow
```

## List the endpoints

To view the API Gateway URL and Event Bus ARN for a service, use the `eventual get service` command:

```ts
> npx eventual get service
API Gateway: 	  https://<uuid>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Event Bus ARN:  arn:aws:events:us-west-2:<account-id>:event-bus/my-service
```

## Make an API HTTP request

Use a tool like `curl` to make an HTTP request to the API Gateway endpoint for the `/work` API. This will trigger a workflow execution:

```
> curl -X POST https://<uuid>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/work\
  -d '["item1", "item2"]'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

This will return a JSON object containing the execution ID for the triggered workflow execution.

```json
{ "executionId": "<execution-id>" }
```

## Get the logs for the execution

To view the logs for the workflow execution we just started, use the `eventual get logs` command followed by the `--execution` flag and the execution ID:

```
> npx eventual get logs --execution <execution-id>
```
