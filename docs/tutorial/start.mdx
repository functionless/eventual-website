## What we're building

This tutorial will walk through, end-to-end, the process of building a Service that supports submitting tasks, waiting for a person to approve the task, and then completing the task. It will demonstrate how to build APIs, a human-in-the-loop workflow and publish events.

## Set Up

First, create a new project.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<Tabs groupId="npm">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    <CodeBlock>npm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    <CodeBlock>yarn create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">
    <CodeBlock>pnpm create eventual@latest</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, delete the sample code that comes with the template `packages/service/src/hello.ts` and `packages/service/test/hello.test.ts`
