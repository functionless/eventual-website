# Wrap Up

And thats it, we now have a long running workflow with 2 exposed commands to interact with and an event that is emitted each
time the workflow completes successfully.

We can expand this in the future by adding more events, handling more error cases, introducing timeouts, and more.

Head over to the [reference section](../reference) to find features not covered in the tutorial like replaying workflows from previous executions, writing unit tests for your service, subscribing to events, streaming changes from entities, and more.

And please come chat with us on [discord](https://discord.gg/8hfnTn3QDT) and follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/EventualCloud).
