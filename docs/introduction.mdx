Eventual makes building and operating resilient event-driven applications easy at any scale.

- **Code-first APIs, Events and Workflows** - build durable, scalable and event-driven systems with end-to-end type safety that spans across service boundaries.
- **Composable Microservices** - architect microservices that are fully serverless, composable, evolve naturally and have minimal operational complexity.
- **Your Cloud and Security Boundaries** - runs in your cloud, governed by your security and privacy policies, and integrates with your favorite IaC framework.
