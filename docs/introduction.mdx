# Introduction

Eventual makes building and operating resilient event-driven applications easy at any scale.

- **Powerful orchestration and choreography** - build durable, long-running Workflows, scale APIs, publish and subscribe to Events, and connect to SaaS via Integrations.
- **Event-driven** - build asynchronous systems that are more resilient, scalable and evolvable.
- **Serverless** - fully serverless, load-based pricing that scales to $0 and minimal operational complexity.
- **Composable and Evolvable** - loosely coupled architectures makes it easy to add new services and evolve your system over time.
- **Code-first** - end-to-end type safety that spans across service boundaries, from APIs to Events to long-running Workflows.
- **Your cloud, your security boundaries** - runs on your cloud infrastructure, with transparent billing and total control over data and security.
- **Distributed as IaC** - integrates with your favorite Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) frameworks such as the AWS CDK and SST.
